Problem Statement ID: 1595 | Title: SynoDrive: Coordinated Autonomous Traffic System | Department: Ministry Of Education's Innovation Cell(MIC) | Smart Vehicles

Greetings Online Community, Here we are Team SynoDrive: Coordinated Autonomous Traffic System.

What's SynoDrive?:
"Syno" derives from "synergy" and "synchronization," emphasizing the seamless coordination between vehicles and infrastructure.
"Drive" highlights the core focus on autonomous vehicles and their adaptive, intelligent navigation.
The name conveys the idea of a synchronized, cooperative system that drives efficiency, safety, and traffic optimization.

Why SynoDrive?(Statistical Perspective):
To reduce Traffic, deconstruct traffic, and have a smooth trafiic flow.

We must confront a sobering reality—one that is unfolding every day on the roads we travel. In 2022 alone, India witnessed a staggering 461,312 road accidents, an 11.9% increase from the previous year. Behind this figure are not just statistics but stories—tragic losses, shattered families, and immeasurable grief.
The number of fatalities is equally alarming. In 2022, 168,491 lives were lost in road accidents, marking a 9.4% increase from the previous year. These are not just numbers; they are fathers, mothers, children, friends—people whose futures were cut short in the blink of an eye.

Even more disturbing is the fact that 443,366 people were injured in road accidents, a 15.3% rise from the previous year. Many of them will bear the scars, both physical and emotional, for a lifetime.
What is striking is the rural-urban divide. Sixty-eight percent of road accident deaths occurred in rural areas, while 32% were in urban areas. Despite the contrasts in lifestyle, road safety remains a shared crisis across India. Two-wheelers, the most common form of transport, were involved in 44.5% of these accidents, claiming a similarly large proportion of lives. It’s clear that safety on our roads, especially for two-wheeler users, requires urgent attention.

The age group most affected—those between 18 and 60—constitutes 83.4% of road accident deaths. These are people in the prime of their lives, contributing to families, communities, and the nation’s economy. Their loss represents an enormous human and economic toll on our society.
On a global scale, India accounts for around 6% of the world’s road accidents, despite only having about 1% of the world’s vehicles. This disproportionate number is a stark reminder that road safety measures must be prioritized immediately.

Each year, drowsy driving is responsible for 100,000 crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities, according to the National Safety Council. These are preventable losses, and yet they continue to happen.
The situation becomes even graver when we consider the 24,012 patients in India who die every day due to delays in receiving medical help—often because ambulances are stuck in traffic. This is more than a road safety issue; it’s a public health crisis.
Traffic congestion in our urban centers compounds this problem. The economic cost of congestion in major cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi amounts to approximately $22 billion annually, as we lose time, waste fuel, and increase pollution. In Mumbai, the average commuter spends 65% more time in traffic than they would in free-flowing conditions. Bengaluru ranks as the 6th most congested city globally, where commuters experience an additional 243 hours of delay each year.

The numbers tell us one thing: our roads are not just a means of getting from point A to point B. They are a reflection of how we prioritize safety, efficiency, and life itself. We cannot allow this to be the status quo. It is time for action, for smarter policies, better infrastructure, and, above all, a collective effort to ensure that we make it safely to our destinations.
